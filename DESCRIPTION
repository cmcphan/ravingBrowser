Description: A web app interface for interactively exploring regulatory
    elements in healthy skeletal muscle using data produced by the RAVING
    Consortium at the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research. Pulling
    together data from multiple different analysis modalities, including
    Hi-C, ChIP-seq, snRNA-seq ... , the browser provides a comprehensive
    dataset of regulatory elements which can help to guide further
    research.
