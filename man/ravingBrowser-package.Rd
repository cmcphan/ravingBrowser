\title{ravingBrowser: Browser interface for exploring skeletal muscle regulatory elements}
\description{
A web app interface for interactively exploring regulatory elements in healthy skeletal muscle using data produced by the RAVING Consortium at the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research. Pulling together data from multiple different analysis modalities, including Hi-C, ChIP-seq, snRNA-seq ... , the browser provides a comprehensive dataset of regulatory elements which can help to guide further research.
