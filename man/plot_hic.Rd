\title{Plot a HiC contact matrix}
\usage{
plot_hic(
  chr,
  start,
  end,
  resolution,
  normalization = "KR",
  format = "triangular"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{chr}{An integer value representing the chromosome of the region to be plotted}

\item{start, end}{Integer values representing the start and end coordinates
(in base pairs) of the region to be plotted}

\item{resolution}{An integer value representing the bin size of the contact matrix.
A smaller bin size represents a higher plot resolution and uses higher
resolution data at the back end. Must be present in the underlying data.}

\item{normalization}{String describing the normalization method to apply to the
count matrix. Default is 'KR'(Knight-Ruiz). Must be present in the
underlying data.}

\item{format}{String describing the output format for the plot. Default is
'triangular', which shows the upper triangle of the contact matrix for the
specified region. May also be 'square', which plots the full symmetrical matrix,
or 'rectangular', which plots the upper triangle but with additional data
points filled in from surrounding areas.}
}
