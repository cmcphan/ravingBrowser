\usage{
run_app(
  onStart = options(scipen = 10),
  options = list(launch.browser = FALSE),
  enableBookmarking = NULL,
  uiPattern = "/",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{onStart}{A function that will be called before the app is actually run.
For this app we choose to set an option that prevents integers from being returned in scientific notation.}

\item{options}{Named options that should be passed to the \code{runApp} call
(these can be any of the following: "port", "launch.browser", "host", "quiet",
"display.mode" and "test.mode"). For this app we set launch.browser to FALSE to make sure the app
runs without needing the default browser to be set.}

\item{enableBookmarking}{Can be one of \code{"url"}, \code{"server"}, or
\code{"disable"}. The default value, \code{NULL}, will respect the setting from
any previous calls to  \code{\link[shiny:enableBookmarking]{enableBookmarking()}}. See \code{\link[shiny:enableBookmarking]{enableBookmarking()}}
for more information on bookmarking your app.}

\item{uiPattern}{A regular expression that will be applied to each \code{GET}
request to determine whether the \code{ui} should be used to handle the
request. Note that the entire request path must match the regular
expression in order for the match to be considered successful.}

\item{...}{arguments to pass to golem_opts.
See \code{?golem::get_golem_options} for more details.}
